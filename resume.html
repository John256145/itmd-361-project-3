		  <h2>Projects</h2>
		  <h3><em>MemoryBeach Mobile App</em></h3>
		  <p>Developed a prototype for MemoryBeach's Guide game for Android devices with a team of other interns experienced in Java and UI/UX design.</p>
		  <p>The goal of the app is to generate a quiz for the user, as well as save their score and recommend their personalized 'wave' of products. The app also seamlessly keeps track of scores between itself and the web app when the user is signed in to their account.</p>
		  <p>After the prototyping process completed, the project was handed off to the senior developers. The final application contains several elements of our prototype, which were considered during our weekly meetings. </p>
		  <h3><a href="http://pro-planner.appspot.com/"><em>Pro Planner Web App</em></a></h3>
		  <p>Developed a web app using several languages with a team of other brilliant CSSI participants after two weeks of comprehensive instruction from Google engineers.</p>
		  <p>Utilizing the Google Places API, the web app recommends places near the user’s location for an outing with friends and family. It stores users’ personalized results under their Google Account, which can also be shared with The Gallery database, for others to see.</p>
